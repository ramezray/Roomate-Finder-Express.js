# Roomate-Finder-Express.js
Created during Week 13 of University of Washington Coding Bootcamp. The goal was to create a dating app but, I decide to make it Rommate finder, using Node and Express servers. The user enters the home page that had a buttom that take he/she to a survey page. When the user submits the survey, they are matched with a previous user that has the closest match to their personality.
